Part One: Go to the Social Security Administration US births website and select the births table there and copy it to your clipboard. Use the pandas read_clipboard function to read the table into Python, and use matplotlib to plot male and female births for the years covered in the data. Put this in an ipython notebook file. In the same notebook, use Python to get a list of male and female names from these files This data is broken down by year of birth. 
Part Two: Aggregate the data for all years (see the examples in the Pandas notebooks). Use Python Counters to get letter frequencies for male and female names. Use matplotlib to draw a plot that for each letter (x-axis) shows the frequency of that letter (y-axis) as the last letter for both for male and female names. 
Part Three: Now do just female names, but aggregate your data in decades (10 year) increments. Produce a plot that contains the 1880s line, the 1940s line, and the 1990s line, as well as the female line for all years aggregated together from Part Two. Evaluate how stable this statistic is. Speculate on why it is is stable, if it is, or on what demographic facts might explain any changes, if there are any. Turn in your ipython notebook file, showing the code you used to complete parts One, Two, an Three.
